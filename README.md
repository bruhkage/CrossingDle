# CrossingDle
An Animal Crossing guessing game made in Python using Tkinter.

The CrossingDle is an Animal Crossiing villager guessing game inspired by games like Wordle. You have a maximum of 7 attempts to guess the correct villager while gaining more information after based of each guess.

Daily Mode: Guess the villager of the day.
Unlimited Mode: Play endlessly with a different villager to guess each time.

It is written in python and heavly uses libaries like Tkinter, Pandas and Pillow as well as a few other minorly used ones. The code is pretty messy and janky but atleast it works without any noticable bugs.
